CMake Warning at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:76 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindKF5DocTools.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "KF5DocTools", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "KF5DocTools"
  (requested version 5.113.0) with any of the following names:

    KF5DocToolsConfig.cmake
    kf5doctools-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "KF5DocTools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "KF5DocTools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "KF5DocTools" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

  package:

  KF5KDELibs4Support could not be found because dependency KF5DocTools could
  not be found.
