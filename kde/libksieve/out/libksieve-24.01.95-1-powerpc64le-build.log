CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:56 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake

  but it set Qt6_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6" is considered to be NOT
  FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Failed to find required Qt component "WebEngineWidgets".

  Expected Config file at
  "/usr/lib/cmake/Qt6WebEngineWidgets/Qt6WebEngineWidgetsConfig.cmake" does
  NOT exist



  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Qt6WebEngineWidgets might reveal details
  why the package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.
