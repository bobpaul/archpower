Subject: [PATCH] Curl_http2_setup: don't change connection data on repeat
 invokes

Regression from 3cb8a748670ab88c (releasde in 7.79.0). That change moved
transfer oriented inits to before the check but also erroneously moved a
few connection oriented ones, which causes problems.

Reported-by: Evangelos Foutras
Fixes #7730
Closes #7731
